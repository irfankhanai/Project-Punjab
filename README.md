# Approx 140,000 datapoints
Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing temperature trends and developing predictive models for 15 major cities in Punjab, Pakistan, over the period from 2000 to 2024. The study aims to understand the impacts of climate change, particularly how temperature trends and unexpected rainfall patterns may affect the region, which is known for its dense population and susceptibility to climate-related changes.
Key objectives include:
•	Conducting empirical analysis on historical temperature data.
•	Forecasting future temperature trends using machine learning techniques.
•	Evaluating the effects of climate change, such as flooding, due to temperature anomalies.
Workflow for Python Coding
The workflow for Python coding in this project involves multiple stages, each contributing to the analysis and model development process.
1. Data Import and Preprocessing
•	Data import: data was provided by Ministry of climate change Pakistan in csv file. It was loaded into python using pandas import.
•	Data cleaning: Removing any missing or corrupted data points.
•	Data transformation: Scaling or normalizing features, converting time-series data into appropriate formats.
•	Feature engineering: Creating new features from raw data to improve the model’s performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables. Key tasks include:
•	Visualizing temperature trends across different cities over time.
•	Identifying seasonality, trends, and outliers in the dataset.
•	Understanding correlations between temperature data and other factors such as rainfall.
•	Automation: In starting all EDA was applied to single city and then the whole process was extended to 15 cities using a very smart automation approach.
3. Time-Series Forecasting
In this step:
•	Historical temperature data is used to build time-series models.
•	Cross-validation is applied to assess the robustness of the models.
4. Machine Learning Model Development
Machine learning models are developed to predict temperature trends and analyze climate change effects:
•	Hyperparameter tuning and model selection are performed to optimize performance.
5. Validation and Evaluation
After training the models, it is essential to validate and evaluate their performance. This includes:
•	Evaluating model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2.
•	Assessing generalizability using cross-validation and testing on unseen data.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the future temperature trends of Punjab’s cities and assist policymakers and climate experts in preparing for future climate events.
